# Gathermate2 Autogenerated data

This project takes the data from retail wowhead and produces data for Retail and Classic (Currently Catazclysm) data by converting the retail zones to classic zones, and limiting the dataset to nodes and zones found in classic.

# Data Merge (Coming soon)

The intention is to collect data from the following sources depending on game version. Then ensure duplicated (within +/- 0.1 x/y) are removed. It'll be suggested to run the in game cleanup upon import since map co-ordinates are not the same map for map, to ensure there's not spam data in your maps.
